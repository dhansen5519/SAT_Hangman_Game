## Final Status Report

### Goal of Project
Studying for the SAT is tough. Our goal is to help students study vocabulary using the fun and easy to understand game of Hangman. The home page of the application will have a leaderboard of the top scorers to give students a goal to beat the top scores. The hangman game will use a common SAT word. Players will be able to skip a word if they choose and also get a hint using the word definition. Once they complete the game they will see a summary page of their results. The website will also have a game rules page and a page with general game statistics.

### Completed

1. Home page with leaderboard
2. Hangman game
    * Enter a custom username to start the game
    * Game interface

    * Notify user if correct or incorrect selections
    * Update score
    * Show attempts remaining
3. Game results page

### To-Do
1. Implement final logic for Get Hint button
2. Implement final logic for Skip Word button
3. Implement final logic for Extra Life button

### Plans for the future

1. Allow the user to continue the game beyond one completed word. This will allow the user to successfully complete multiple vocabulary words.
2. Update the Statistics page to include visualizations of activity of users.
3. Allow users to login and see information for past games.
4. Categorize the words by level so users may start off at an easier level and work their way up to solving the more difficult words.

### Known bugs
1. The buttons "Get Hint", "Skip Word", and "Extra Life" are not currently working on the game page.
