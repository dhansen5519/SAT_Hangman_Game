## Vision statement: what would you tell potential customers?
Studying for the SAT is tough. Our goal is to help students study vocabulary using the fun and easy to understand game of Hangman. The home page of the application will have a leaderboard of the top scorers to give students a goal to beat the top scores. The hangman games will use a common SAT word. Some may have hints depending on the word difficulty and the number of tries to guess the word will also be dependent on the word difficulty.

## Motivation: why are you working on this project?
This project will help students study SAT vocabulary in a fun environment.

## Risks to project completion:
* New development environment
* No prior experience working with these team members
* Learning a new web framework
* Team members located in different time-zones and have family/work obligations that do not allow for daily meetings

## Mitigation Strategy for above risks
* Early on in project make sure questions about development environment are brought forward to the Professor
* Weekly meetings and communication on Discord to help team members get to know each other better
* Start framework documentation review early, to have time for learning and asking questions
* Team using Discord so members may easily communicate from computer or phones


## Development method: Scrum
* Weekly scrum meeting
* Sprint planning meeting every other week
* 2-week sprints
