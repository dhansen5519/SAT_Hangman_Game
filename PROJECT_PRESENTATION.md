## Vision and Description

Studying for the SAT is tough. Our goal is to help students study vocabulary using the fun and easy to understand game of Hangman. The home page of the application will have a leaderboard of the top scorers to give students a goal to beat the top scores. The hangman game will use a common SAT word. Players will be able to skip a word if they choose and also get a hint using the word definition. Once they complete the game they will see a summary page of their results. The website will also have a game rules page and a page with general game statistics.

## Tools

### Jira 
Used for tracking project tasks. Allowed team members to keep track of the team's work and progress. \
https://cspb-3308-team-3-2024.atlassian.net/ \
Evaluation: Excellent

### Github
Used for version control. Allows team members to work on their branches separately and integrate with the team codebase. \
https://github.com/rwcunningham/CSPB_3308_Team_3_2024 \
Evaluation: Excellent

### Discord
Used for asynchronous communication. Team members are able to respond on desktop computers and mobile phones. \
Evaluation: Excellent

### Zoom
Used for weekly team meetings. Team members are able to easily share screens for demos and explanations. Team members are able to access on desktop computers and mobile phones. \
Evaluation: Excellent

### Python/Flask
Web framework and back-end language selected for the project. As we covered this in our course, everyone on the team was familiar with the framework and language and this allowed for faster development. \
Evaluation: Excellent

### MySQL
Database selected for project. Some team members had experience with the database and were able to get the other team members up to speed. A couple of team members had difficulty installing locally. \
Evaluation: Good

### Visual Studio Code
Code editor used by the team. Visual Studio Code has been available in CSEL so team members were already familiar with the application. \
Evaluation: Excellent

## Challenges

1. Use of MySQL database. Multiple team members had difficulty installing and setting up MySQL locally. In one of our weekly meetings we shared screens so we could walk through the process of the installation and answer any questions. We also developed an alternative set-up using containers although that did not need to be used. We developed scripts to automate the set-up of the database tables and import initial data to make the set-up easier.

2. Set-up of local environment. Some team members were not used to running Flask and programming in Python locally. They ran into issues when trying to run the application locally. To address this we created a DEV_SETUP readme file to help everyone get their local environment configured correctly. As the project progressed, we continued to update that readme so team members always had an up-to-date reference.

3. Team members located in different time-zones. This made it difficult at times to communicate in a timely manner when team members had questions. As a team we did our best to check notifications in Discord and email to make sure team members were able to receive responses quickly.

4. Using git locally and going through the process of a pull request. Some teammembers have mainly stayed within the university JupyterLab environment, so utilizing a local VS Code for a group project with multiple branches was a fun exploration and expansion of skills for some. The labs from this class and other classes provided a good base that this project built upon.
